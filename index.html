    <h4>What is CSS Grid?</h4>
    <p>CSS Grid is a new way for us to apply a layout in CSS. Prior to Flexbox, aligning and positioning itmes, especially vertically had always been a problem for developers. With the arrival of Flex box, centering and spacing items both horizontally became much easier. CSS Grid takes that to the next level.</p>
    <p>At its most simple, CSS Grid allows you to define a grid on your webpage and assign elements in that page to take up whatever grid areas you want. Imagine if you were to draw a box on plain white paper. It's probably not lined up properly, it's size may not be exactly what you want. Now imagine you drew a box on a sheet of graph paper, using only the lines on the paper to draw a box. CSS Grid works in a similar fashion, only you get to design the graph paper, or in our case, grid lines!</p>
    <h4>A Note About Design</h4>
    <p>One thing to keep in mind is that some times as we build websites, it's easy to fall into the mindset of 'Build as I go'. You can start to think, "I have an idea of how I want this to look, I'll just try stuff out until it work". It is very important that with CSS Grid, you have at the very least the layout portion of your design done BEFORE you start coding. Use of wireframe tools or image programs like PhotoShop and GIMP is highly recommended when coming up with initial design and how you want your site to look, and it's a good practice to get in to.</p>
