    <h1>The Last Touches</h1>
    <p>So now we have our four sections, but you may notice that there's a space in our example, but here all the boxes are pushed right next to each other. How do you fix that? Glad you asked!</p>

    <h4>Gap Commands</h4>
    <p>You can use the <b>grid-column-gap</b> and <b>grid-row-gap</b> to create a space between sections. These commands <b>must</b> be applied to the parent element, not the children. Also note this will only apply to the elements that you have already declared. This will not break up an existing block to make a bunch of gaps. Lets put the commands in first. You specify the length of the gap with standard CSS length notation, in our case, lets make a 10 pixel gap. Remember to apply it to the container!</p>
    <div class="figure">
        <span>grid-row-gap: 10px;</span><br>
        <span>grid-column-gap: 10px;</span><br>
    </div>
    <p>Now we have some space in between our sections. You should notice that it didn't actually break up our header and footer even though that span multiple grid boxes. Grid-gap only effects grid lines outside of the areas that you have declared.</p>
    <p>You may notice that if we shrink our browser, our aside section might get a little smaller than we would like. Is there a way to declare a minimum and maximum height? There sure is.</p>

    <h4>Minmaxing our aside</h4>
    <p>When you declare the lengths or your columns and rows inside the parent container, you can use the <b>minmax()</b> command to ensure that the length will never fall outside of a certain value. The minmax will take two parameters, the minimum length and the maximum length. Keep in mind that this only works when one of your values is a dynamix value that will may change based on the browser size, such as percent. So lets try this out where we declare our column lengths. Adjust your <b>grid-template-columns</b> inside our container to the following.</p>
    <div class="figure">
        <span>grid-template-columns: minmax(150px, 20%) 80%;</span><br>
    </div>
    <p>Now lets explain what this is doing: This ensures that the width of that column will be 20% of the viewport <b>unless</b> it falls under 150 pixels. Neato!</p>

    <h4>The (fr)actional Unit</h4>
    <p>Have you ever wanted to divide your sections but didn't want to figure out the exact percentages? Then the fractional unit is for you. You can list a length followed by <b>fr</b> as a unit of measurement that represents a fraction of the available space. For example</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Four columns set to 1fr each will give you 4 even columns</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Two columns set to 1fr and one row set to 2fr will give you one column that is twice as big as the other two. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Having one column set to 4fr and one set to 1fr will give you 2 total columns with one column being 4 times as big as the other.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>We can actually use the last example on that list for our example. We have our main get to 80% and our aside set to 20%. Since one is 4 times greater than the other, we can re-write that column length as such:</p>
    <div class="figure">
        <span>grid-template-columns: minmax(150px, 1fr) 4fr;</span><br>
    </div>
    <p>Now we are utlizing fraction units. These are very useful when you would rather deal with width as a ratio as opposed to a raw percentage.</p>
    <h4>All done?</h4>
    <p>Congratulations, we just made our first grid layout? You may have come across a though while you were looking at the minmax stuff. This isn't very responsive! How can we rearrange this so that it looks cleaner on mobile phones? Check out the bonus content. (This does involve media queries, so make sure you are familiar with them)</p>
